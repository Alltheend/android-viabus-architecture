# Why ViaBus?
- In 1 minute, you can understand the structure and use of ViaBus. üí°
- It can be used at the moment, completely compatible with the original project architecture, plug and play. üî•
- Allows incremental refactoring in one hour per day, in business or module units. üíß
- The structure is self-contained, purely natural decoupling, and no longer has to worry about the troubles of lazy colleagues. üå±
- Real time two-way communication across Activity and cross components can be completed just through the native interface. ‚ö°
- Less repetitive work, flat data interaction, and code reuse rate up to 100%. üí™
- ...
