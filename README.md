# What's ViaBus?
⭐ ViaBus is a responsive architecture, driven by message bus programming, to achieve complete decoupling of UI and business.

# Why ViaBus?
- In 1 minute, you can understand the structure and use of ViaBus. 💡
- It can be used at the moment, completely compatible with the original project architecture, plug and play. 🔥
- Allows incremental refactoring in one hour per day, in business or module units. 💧
- Complete decoupling, no matter writing UI or writing business, is no longer interrupted and not dragged together. 🌱
- Real time two-way communication across Activity and cross components can be completed just through the native interface. ⚡
- No compile time annotation, and components written in Viabus can be used directly in any project.🌎
- Less repetitive work, flat data interaction, and code reuse rate up to 100%. 💪
