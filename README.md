# What's ViaBus?
⭐ ViaBus is a responsive architecture, driven by message bus programming, to achieve complete decoupling of UI and business.

# Why ViaBus?
- Both of you and I are brave enough to grasp the essence of things, and constantly iterate the highly effective and efficient people.🌱
- This framework clearly defines what is UI and what is business, which provides a realistic basis for code decoupling.💡
- In the past, it took 2 hours to change the demand, but now, plus the unit test, took only 30 minutes.🔥
- In the past, three people had to work overtime for one month, but now only one person took two hours of incremental reconstruction every day.💧
- In the past, writers of UI and presenter had to work overtime to meet the needs of temporary changes, but now they are not dragging on each other, independent and self-governing, and focused on their respective fields.🌲
- Formerly, real-time two-way communication across Activity and components could only be accomplished by third-party libraries, but now it can be accomplished through native interfaces.⚡
- Previously, there was a lot of duplication in the architecture, and the code was redundant. Now every class you write is taken advantage of.💪
